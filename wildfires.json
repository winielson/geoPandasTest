Typically the wildfire season begins in July; so far in 2020, there have been more fires than average in Brazil due to a drier-than-normal spring and summer.\nWildfires are a typical feature of the Brazilian summer, particularly after long dry spells or during extreme temperatures, and can lead to evacuations, road closures, and ground transport diversions. Disruptions to arterial roads are possible. The scarcity of alternative routes in the Amazon Rainforest means that significant transport disruptions are possible at times. Authorities may restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles on sections of federal highways if local temperatures exceed 38 C (100 F) and could declare local states of emergency to facilitate the emergency response to severe incidents. While authorities are experienced in minimizing the potential impact, travel along roads in remote regions is likely to be disrupted for more extended periods.\n<em>Health<\/em><br\/>Smoke from wildfires is a mixture of gases and fine particles from burning trees, plants, and possibly building materials. Such smoke can hurt eyes, irritate the respiratory system, and worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. Smoke may also worsen symptoms for people who have pre-existing respiratory conditions - such as respiratory allergies, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n<em>Transport<\/em><br\/>Heavy smoke can impede visibility, producing hazardous driving conditions on some roads and could prompt short-notice flight disruptions if wildfires occur near airports. Railways can also experience occasional cancellation of services and long delays, especially in regions with limited alternative routes.\nAdvice\nMaintain flexible itineraries if traveling in Brazil, particularly in remote, rural areas through October. Seek updated information on road conditions if planning to travel near affected areas; exercise caution if smoke reduces visibility. Review and update emergency action plans in rural areas. If based in an affected area that is not under evacuation warnings, consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Heed all instructions from local authorities and emergency response personnel.\nResources\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.inmet.gov.br\/portal\/\">Brazil National Institute of Meteorology (INMET)<\/a>\n\n",

The fire edge is located approximately 15 km (10 miles) west of Fort Collins and has been burning since Aug. 13. As of early Sept. 22, the blaze was approximately 42,150 hectares (104,157 acres) in size and 15-percent contained. The fire is threatening several structures. More than 839 personnel are on-site battling the blaze. Authorities have not provided an estimated containment date. Forecast models indicate that hot and dry conditions will continue over the coming days, which may hamper containment efforts and allow for additional wildfire growth.\nSeveral evacuation orders and transport disruptions are ongoing and can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/nocoalert.org\/\">here<\/a>. An emergency shelter for displaced residents is located at Cache La Poudre Middle School in Laporte. Authorities could expand mandatory evacuation orders or voluntary evacuations depending on evolving wildfire conditions. Anticipate the status of nearby roads to change over the coming hours and days; authorities could close routes within the wildfire complex and evacuated communities due to fire activity and the needs of response operations. Traffic flows could also be disrupted during re-entry periods after authorities lift evacuation orders. Low visibility from smoke and possible ashfall could contribute to traffic delays and congestion in the region.\nAdvice\nHeed all evacuation orders. Seek updated information on road conditions if driving in the affected area; road closures and detours will cause increased congestion and delays. Collect essential items - including identification and any important legal and travel documents - in a “go-bag” that can be easily accessed.

Oregon Governor Kate Brown has issued a statewide state of emergency due to further threat of wildfires. Several counties, including Marion and Clackamas, have declared their own local states of emergency. At least 500,000 residents across Oregon were forced to evacuate; however, many evacuation orders have since been lifted. Authorities have not provided an estimated containment time frame. Firefighters have made significant progress in containing the fires. Forecast models indicate additional rounds of rain and thunderstorms will impact much of western Oregon through at least Sept. 24, which should further aid in the relief efforts and reduce air quality concerns.\nCurrently, many fires are burning across Oregon, but the most impactful are Archie Creek, Beachie Creek, Holiday Farm, Lionshead, Riverside, South Obenchain, Almeda Drive, and Slater-Devil. These fires have prompted numerous evacuation orders across the state.\nAdditionally, authorities have closed Mount Hood National Forest to the public until further notice. Authorities could expand or rescind mandatory evacuation orders depending on evolving wildfire conditions.\n<em>Archie Creek<\/em><br\/>The Archie Creek Fire is burning in the North Umpqua corridor and is approximately 34 km (21 miles) east of Roseburg.

Traffic flows could also be disrupted during re-entry periods after authorities lift evacuation orders. Low visibility from smoke and possible ashfall could contribute to traffic delays and congestion in the region.\n<em>Health<\/em><br\/>Individuals not under evacuation warnings should consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Individuals with chronic respiratory illnesses may be more susceptible to the negative effects of smoke inhalation. Eye irritation is possible; flush irritated eyes with copious amounts of clean water.\nAdvice\nHeed all evacuation orders. Seek updated information on road conditions if driving in the affected area; road closures and detours will cause increased congestion and delays. Individuals not under evacuation warnings should consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Collect essential items - including identification and any important legal and travel documents - in a \"go-bag\" that can be easily accessed. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged power outages.\n\n", "update_timestamp": "09\/23\/2020 16:30" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [

Traffic flows could also be disrupted during re-entry periods after authorities lift evacuation orders. Low visibility from smoke and possible ashfall could contribute to traffic delays and congestion in the region.\n<em>Health<\/em><br\/>Individuals not under evacuation warnings should consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Individuals with chronic respiratory illnesses may be more susceptible to the negative effects of smoke inhalation. Eye irritation is possible; flush irritated eyes with copious amounts of clean water.\nAdvice\nHeed all evacuation orders. Seek updated information on road conditions if driving in the affected area; road closures and detours will cause increased congestion and delays. Individuals not under evacuation warnings should consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Collect essential items - including identification and any important legal and travel documents - in a \"go-bag\" that can be easily accessed. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged power outages.\nResources\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fire.ca.gov\/\">California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE)<\/a>\n\n",

Wildfires are a typical feature of the summer and fall across the western US, particularly after long dry spells or during extremely high temperatures. Forecast models indicate the wildfire season is expected to be above average this year, especially in the Great Basin region and northern California.\n<em>Transport and Utilities<\/em><br\/>Wildfires can lead to evacuations, road closures, and ground transport diversions. Disruptions to arterial roads are possible. The scarcity of alternative routes in some areas means that significant transport disruptions are possible at times. While authorities are experienced in minimizing the potential impact, roads in remote regions are likely to be disrupted for more extended periods due to their relative inaccessibility. Authorities could close routes in the wildfire complex and evacuate communities due to fire activity and the needs of response operations. Traffic flows could also be disrupted during re-entry periods after authorities lift evacuation orders.\nLow visibility from smoke and possible ashfall could contribute to traffic delays, congestion, and prompt short-notice flight disruptions if wildfires occur near airports.\nRailways can also experience occasional cancellation of services and long delays. Power outages are possible in places due to damaged infrastructure or intentional power cuts to prevent infrastructure damage or to help prevent the spread of the fires.\n<em>Health<\/em><br\/>Smoke from wildfires is a mixture of gases and fine particles from burning trees, plants, and possibly building materials. Such smoke can hurt eyes, irritate the respiratory system, and worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. Smoke may also worsen symptoms for people who have pre-existing respiratory conditions - such as respiratory allergies, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nAdvice\nHeed all evacuation orders. Seek updated information on road conditions if driving in the affected area; road closures and detours will cause increased congestion and delays. Individuals not under evacuation warnings should consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Collect essential items - including identification and any important legal and travel documents - in a \"go-bag\" that can be easily accessed. Charge battery-powered devices in case of prolonged power outages.\nResources\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.weather.gov\">National Weather Service<\/a>\n\n", "update_timestamp": "09\/23\/2020 16:30" },

Wildfires are a typical feature of the Grecian summer, particularly after long dry spells or during extreme temperatures, and can lead to evacuations, road closures, and ground transport diversions. Forecast models indicate the wildfire season is expected to be above average this year especially in the central and northern regions of the country.\n<em>Transport and Utilities<\/em><br\/>Wildfires can lead to evacuations, road closures, and ground transport diversions. Disruptions to arterial roads are possible. The scarcity of alternative routes in some areas means that significant transport disruptions are possible at times. While authorities are experienced in minimizing the potential impact, roads in remote regions are likely to be disrupted for more extended periods due to their relative inaccessibility. Authorities could close routes in the wildfire complex and evacuated communities due to fire activity and the needs of response operations. Traffic flows could also be disrupted during re-entry periods after authorities lift evacuation orders. Low visibility from smoke and possible ashfall could contribute to traffic delays, congestion, and prompt short-notice flight disruptions if wildfires occur near airports. Railways can also experience occasional cancellation of services and long delays. Power outages are possible in places due to damaged infrastructure or intentional power cuts to prevent infrastructure damage or to help prevent the spread of the fires.\n<em>Health<\/em><br\/>Smoke from wildfires is a mixture of gases and fine particles from burning trees, plants, and possibly building materials. Such smoke can hurt eyes, irritate the respiratory system, and worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. Smoke may also worsen symptoms for people who have pre-existing respiratory conditions - such as respiratory allergies, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nAdvice\nHeed all evacuation orders. Seek updated information on road conditions if driving in the affected area; road closures and detours will cause increased congestion and delays. Individuals not under evacuation warnings should consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Collect essential items - including identification and any important legal and travel documents - in a \"go-bag\" that can be easily accessed. Charge battery-powered devices in case of prolonged power outages.\nResources\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hnms.gr\/\">Hellenic National Meteorological Service<\/a>\n\n", "update_timestamp": "09\/23\/2020

Typically the wildfire season begins in June, however due to an abnormally dry winter in 2019-2020 and record warm May and June, the wildfire season has started ahead of schedule.\nWildfires are a typical feature of the Russian summer, particularly after long dry spells or during extreme temperatures, and can lead to evacuations, road closures, and ground transport diversions. Disruption to arterial roads, including the Trans-Siberian Highway, is possible. The scarcity of alternative routes in some areas means that significant transport disruptions are possible at times. Authorities may restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles on sections of federal highways if local temperatures exceed 32 C (90 F) and could declare local states of emergency to facilitate the emergency response to severe incidents. While authorities are experienced in minimizing the potential impact, roads in remote regions are likely to be disrupted for more extended periods due to their relative inaccessibility.\n<em>Health<\/em><br\/>Smoke from wildfires is a mixture of gases and fine particles from burning trees, plants, and possibly building materials. Such smoke can hurt eyes, irritate the respiratory system, and worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. Smoke may also worsen symptoms for people who have pre-existing respiratory conditions - such as respiratory allergies, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n<em>Transport<\/em><br\/>Heavy smoke can impede visibility, producing hazardous driving conditions on some roads and could prompt short-notice flight disruptions if wildfires occur near airports. Railways can also experience occasional cancellation of services and long delays. In particular, any disruption to the Trans-Siberian Railway will lead to a significantly wider impact due to the lack of alternative routes.\nAdvice\nMaintain flexible itineraries if traveling in Russia, particularly in remote, rural areas through September. Seek updated information on road conditions if planning to travel near affected areas; exercise caution if smoke reduces visibility. Review and update emergency action plans in rural areas. If based in an affected area, not under evacuation warnings, consider remaining inside well-ventilated, air-conditioned spaces to reduce exposure to smoke. Heed all instructions from local authorities and emergency response personnel.\nResources\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteorf.ru\/\">Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environment
